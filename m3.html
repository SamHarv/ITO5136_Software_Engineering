    <h1>Module 3: Project Management</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>The Project Management Triangle (triple constraint, iron triangle)</h2>
    <p>Key factors to be balanced to ensure success of a project. The 
        constraints are interdependent. The Project manager must find balance 
        to meet project objectives and stakeholder expectations.</p>
    <p>Make trade-offs.</p>
    <p>Prevent scope creep.</p>

    <h3>Cost</h3>
    <p>Financial resources needed for successful completion of the project.</p>
    <p>Changes in scope can affect cost.</p>
    <p>Elements of cost include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Budget</li>
        <li>Number of team members</li>
        <li>Equipment and facilities</li>
        <li>Key opportunities</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Time</h3>
    <p>Timeframe, deadlines for completion of requirements.</p>
    <p>Changes in scope or resources can affect timeframe.</p>
    <p>Elements of time include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Overall project timeline</li>
        <li>Hours worked</li>
        <li>Internal calendars and goal posts</li>
        <li>Time for planning</li>
        <li>Number of project phases</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Scope</h3>
    <p>Clearly outlined work that needs to be done - features, functions, 
        deliverables, etc.</p>
    <p>Increase in scope can lead to increased time and cost.</p>
    <p>Elements of scope include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Complexity</li>
        <li>Quantity of requirements finished</li>
        <li>Output quality and strength - how many users it can handle</li>
        <li>Level of detail</li>
        <li>Number of complexity features</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Backlog Refinement (backlog grooming)</h2>
    <p>Reviewing, prioritising and refining items in product backlog to ensure 
        team is working on most valuable and well-defined tasks.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Schedule regular grooming sessions - often once per iteration.</li>
        <li>Invite key stakeholders (product owners, devs, etc.) for 
            refinement sessions.</li>
        <li>Review backlog - start by reviewing existing items - ensure they 
            are up to date and reflect current priorities and requirements.</li>
        <li>Prioritise items - prioritise backlog items with product owner 
            based on business value, customer needs, and strategic goals. Can 
            use framework like MoSCoW prioritisation (Must have, Should have, 
            Could have, Won't have).</li>
        <li>Break down epics - if there are large, high-level features or epics 
            in the backlog, break them down into smaller, more manageable 
            user stories. Each story should represent a valuable piece of 
            functionality that can be developed in a single sprint.</li>
        <li>Estimate user stories - estimate effort required to complete each 
            user story.</li>
        <li>Define acceptance criteria - clearly define acceptance criteria 
            for each user story - conditions that must be met to consider user 
            story complete.</li>
        <li>Remove or reprioritise items - remove outdated or less valuable 
            items from backlog based on new information.</li>
        <li>Groom technical debt - address any identified technical debt from 
            the development process - decide whether to tackle it immediately 
            or schedule it in future sprints.</li>
        <li>Update estimates and priorities after refinement.</li>
        <li>Document discussions from refinement sessions.</li>
        <li>Repeat regularly to facilitate smooth planning.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Task Prioritisation</h2>
    <h3>Goals of task prioritisation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Maximising value - most critical and valuable requirements can be 
            addressed first.</li>
        <li>Managing risk - minimise risk that high-priority items are not 
            completed or cost more later.</li>
        <li>Resource allocation - prioritise allocation of limited resources - 
            time, budget, personell - focus on most important and urgent 
            requirements.</li>
        <li>Stakeholder satisfaction - targets are met.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Prioritisation Methods</h3>
    <p>Choice of method depends on the context of the project.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>MoSCoW Prioritisation - requirements categorised into must-haves 
            (critical to project success), should-haves (important but not 
            critical), could-haves (nice to have but not necessary), and 
            won't-haves (not included in current release but may be considered 
            in future) to indicate priority.</li>
        <li>Numeric scoring - assign numeric scores to requirements based on 
            importance and urgency, and sort them based on score.</li>
        <li>Risk-based prioritisation - prioritise requirements based on their 
            potential impact on project risk.</li>
        <li>Value-based prioritisation - requirements assessed in terms of 
            potential business value or ROI.</li>
        <li>Story mapping - visualise requirements on a timeline to understand 
            flow and sequence of features, helping to prioritise.</li>
        <li>Weighted decision matrices - use matrix to evaluate requirements 
            based on criteria such as cost, value, and feasibility.</li>
    </ul>
