    <h1>Module 4: Software Quality and Testing</h1>
    <p>Principles, methodologies, and best practices related to software 
        quality assurance (SQA) and testing.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Introduction to Software Quality Assurance (SQA)</h2>
    <p>SQA is a set of activities and processes aimed at ensuring software 
        proudcts meet specified quality standards and fulfill customer 
        expectations.</p>
    <p>3 Goals of SQA:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ensuring product has desired quality properties</li>
        <li>Ensuring process by which product was built is of sufficient 
            quality</li>
        <li>Ensuring QA of product and process is of sufficient quality</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>What is software quality?</h3>
    <p>"The degree of conformance to explicit or implicit requirements and 
        expectations" (IEEE n.d.)</p>
    <img src="./images/m4/quality_triangle.png" alt="Diagram of 
    the quality triangle" style="width: 600px;">
    <p>Functional quality (meeting the specified requirements)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The product's compliance with functional (explicit) requirements 
            and design specifications</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Non-functional/ structural quality</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The product's inner characteristics and architecture, i.e. 
            structural (implicit) requirements, e.g. usability, maintainability, 
            uderstandability, efficiency, security and ethics
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Process quality</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A repeatable development process that reliably delivers quality 
            software while meeting delivery dates and budgets</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What are the quality attributes of software systems?</h3>
    <p>Features that facilitate the measurement of a software product's 
        performance by software testing professionals.</p>

    quality attributes" style="width: 600px;">
    <h3>Functional quality</h3>
    <p>Functional completeness</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The measure of how well the system of a component meets all the 
            stated requirements of the user. it measures the degree to which 
            the system or a component includes all the features, functions, and 
            capabilities required.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Functional correctness</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The measure of how accurate and reliable the system or a component 
            is in performing its intended task. It tests the ability of the 
            system or a component to follow the rules and specs correctly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Functional appropriateness</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Measures the degree to which the system or a component meets the 
            user's expectations. It evaluated the system's or the component's 
            ability to perform the tasks it is expected to do in a way that 
            satisfies the user.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Non-functional quality</h3>

    <h2>SQA Approaches</h2>
    <h3>Software Verification and Validation (the V-model)</h3>
    <p>Verification: Being built correctly?</p>
    <p>Validation: Building the right thing?</p>
    <img src="./images/m4/v_model.png" alt="Summary of 
    the V-model of software quality assurance" style="width: 600px;">
    <h3>Waterfall-style SQA</h3>
    <img src="./images/m4/waterfall.png" alt="Summary of 
    waterfall model of software quality assurance" style="width: 600px;">
    <p>Key characteristics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sequential flow: each phase must be completed before the next one 
            begins</li>
        <li>Document-driven: emphasis is placed on extensive documentation 
            at each phase</li>
        <li>Rigid and linear: changes are difficult to accommodate once a phase 
            is complete</li>
        <li>Well-suited for stable requirements: works best when the 
            requirements are well understood and unlikely to change</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Test-driven development (TDD)</h3>
    <p>Software development methodology that revolves around a simple iterative 
        process: write a test, write the minimum amount of code to make that 
        test pass, refactor the code, and repeat. This is referred to as the 
        "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle.</p>
    <img src="./images/m4/tdd.png" alt="Diagram of 
    test-driven development" style="width: 600px;">
    <p>Red: write a test that defines a function or improvements of a function, 
        which should fail initially because the function or feature is not yet 
        implemented. The "Red" phase indicated the test is failing.</p>
    <p>Green: write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the test pass. 
        The goal is not to write perfect or complete code at this point, but to 
        make the test pass.</p>
    <p>Refactor: clean the code while keeping it functional. Refactoring 
        involves improving the structure of the code without changing its 
        behaviour. After refactoring, the tests are run again to ensure the 
        code still works as expected.</p>
    <p>Benefits of TDD:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Early bug detection</li>
        <li>Improved code quality</li>
        <li>Documentation - tests serve as documentation</li>
        <li>Confidence in code changes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>May not be the best fit for everyone.</p>

    <h2>Software Testing</h2>
    <h3>What is software testing?</h3>
    <p>Process of evaluating and verifying that a computer program or system 
        functions as intended. It identifies error, bugs, or defects, and 
        ensures software meets specified requirements.</p>
    <img src="./images/m4/testing.png" alt="Diagram of the objectives and 
    levels of software testing" style="width: 600px;">
    <h3>Large-scale complex software system</h3>
    <p>Challenges:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Software can be complex</li>
        <li>Requirements are subject to change</li>
        <li>Small changes can have large repercussions</li>
        <li>Time and resources are limited</li>
        <li>Lack of access to real-world environments</li>
        <li>Difficulty in reproducing errors</li>
        <li>Some quality requirements are difficult to specifiy in an 
            unambiguous way</li>
    </ul>
