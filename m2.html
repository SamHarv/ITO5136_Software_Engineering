    <h2>Stakeholder Identification and Management</h2>
    <p>Helps build support, mitigate risk, and ensure projects align with 
        expectations and interests of stakeholders.</p>
    <p>Four step process:</p>
    <h3>Identification</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify all relevant stakeholders by systematically identifying 
            individuals, groups, and organisations who may be impacted by or 
            have an impact on the project or initiative</li>
        <li>May include customers, employees, suppliers, regulatory bodies 
            shareholders, competitors, and the general public</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Categorisation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Once identified, stakeholders are categorised into groups based on 
            their level of influence, interest, or involvement in the 
            project</li>
        <li>Common categorisations include primary stakeholders (those directly 
            affected by the project), secondary stakeholders (those indirectly
            affected), and external stakeholders (those outside the 
            organisation)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Understanding</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Gain a deep understanding of each stakeholder's interests, need 
            expectations, and concerns</li>
        <li>Involves communication and engagement with stakeholders to gather 
            information and insights about their perspectives</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Engagement and Communication</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Effective communication is vital for managing stakeholders</li>
        <li>Project managers and teams should establish clear lines of 
            communication with stakeholders, tailoring messages and engagement 
            strategies to suit each group's characteristics and preferences</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Requirement Elicitation Techniques</h2>
    <p>Methods and strategies used to gather information, needs and 
        requirements from stakeholders and users during the early stages of 
        the project.</p>
    <p>Essential to ensure the final product or system aligns with 
        stakeholders' expectations.</p>
    <p>Typically conducted by busines analyst of product owner.</p>

    <h2>How to Write an Effective Survey</h2>
    <h3>1. Preparing your questions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Define your objectives - what information am I trying to gather? 
            How will it help me make informed decisions or draw meaningful 
            conclusions?</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Crafting your questions effectively</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Keep questions clear and concise</li>
        <li>Avoid ambiguity</li>
        <li>One question at a time</li>
        <li>Use neutral language</li>
        <li>Avoid assumptions</li>
        <li>Use rating scales effectively</li>
        <li>Provide response options</li>
        <li>Avoid negative questions</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3. Additional guidelines for question composition</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Question order - start with easier, non-sensitive questions to 
            engage</li>
        <li>Include an "other" or "N/A" option</li>
        <li>Balance response categories to ensure they are not skewed</li>
        <li>Consider skip logic - skip irrelevant questions</li>
        <li>Open-ended questions</li>
        <li>Pilot test your survey</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Writing User Stories and Acceptance Criteria</h2>
    <h3>User stories</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Succinct descriptions of actions a user would want to do with the 
            system: "As a [type of user] (who), I want [some goal] (what) so 
            that [some benefit] (why)".</li>
        <li>Should fit on a sticky note, written simply from the client's 
            perspective.</li>
        <li>Commonly annotated with an estimate of time to implement. Could 
            be hours or days, or represented by something abstract such as 
            T-shirt sizes.</li>
    </ul>

    style="width: 600px;">
    <h3>Acceptance criteria</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Defines user story's boundaries to enable confirmation of whether 
            software is working as expected - defines a successful test 
            result.</li>
    </ul>
